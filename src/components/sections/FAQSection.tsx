      question: "What if this doesn't work for me?",
      answer: "You're covered by our 30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't see improved energy and metabolic function, email us for a full refund. No questions, no hassles."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer: "Most surgeons notice increased energy within the first week. Significant metabolic improvements typically occur within 2-3 weeks as your stress physiology rebalances. Remember, this works WITH your surgical schedule, not against it."
    },
    {
      question: "I've never followed a \"protocol\" before - is this complicated?",
      answer: "Absolutely not. This is designed for surgeons who have zero extra time. Everything is laid out step-by-step with clear instructions. If you can follow a surgical protocol, this will be simple."
    },
    {
      question: "Will this interfere with my demanding schedule?",
      answer: "That's exactly why this exists. Unlike generic programs that require meal prep and gym time, this protocol is built around your erratic schedule and high-stress environment. It works because of your surgical lifestyle, not despite it."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this just another restrictive diet?",
      answer: "No. This isn't about restriction - it's about optimization. You'll learn how to work with your stress hormones and circadian disruption, not fight against them. Most surgeons find this easier than what they were doing before."
