              You now have the full metabolic system top-performing surgeons are using to reclaim mental clarity, sharpen their physiques, and dominate their peers in the OR.

            <p className="text-lg font-semibold">
              But here's the reality nobody talks about:

              Even the most disciplined surgeons lose momentum. Not from lack of willpower or discipline, but because their lifestyle is engineered to create friction.

              Maybe it's a particularly brutal surgery day, and you grab the first piece of food in sight. Maybe it's an emergency late-night operation and you skip the ritual that resets your circadian rhythm.

              That's why most never stick with protocols â€” not because they don't care or don't have discipline, but because they haven't developed a system that optimizes for resiliency when real life inevitably hits you hard.
