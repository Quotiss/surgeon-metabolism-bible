            A review of 25 studies found consistent evidence that fatigue is strongly associated with impaired mitochondrial functionâ€”specifically reduced energy output at the cellular level<sup className="text-blue-600">1</sup>. Another study showed that individuals with better mitochondrial efficiency experienced deeper sleep, improved mood, and fewer signs of burnout and fatigue<sup className="text-blue-600">2</sup>.

            This guide is built to reverse that dysfunction. By targeting the cellular root cause of your symptoms, it helps restore energy, sharpen focus, rebalance hormones, and reignite the drive you thought was lost to age.
