            You sacrificed everything to master the <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">most demanding profession on earth</span>. Decades of your life. Your twenties. Sleep. Relationships. All to earn the right to be <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">the hero that others can rely on</span>.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:mb-6">
            But the system that forged you into a <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">surgical weapon</span> is now <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">systematically destroying</span> the very vitality that made you unstoppable in the first place.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:mb-6 bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-4 rounded-r-lg">
            <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">This isn't your failure. This is systematic betrayal.</span>
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:mb-6">
            While you were perfecting your craft, the mainstream health industry was feeding you <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">one-size-fits-all protocols</span> designed for desk workers and weekend warriors—completely ignoring the <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">unique metabolic chaos</span> your high-stakes surgical career creates.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:mb-6">
            Every <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">24-hour shift</span>. Every <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">3 AM emergency call</span>. Every <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">life-or-death decision</span> has patients' livelihoods resting on your shoulders. Your body adapted to survive this <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">surgical warfare</span>... but those same adaptations are now <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">cannibalizing your metabolism</span> from the inside.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:mb-6">
            Now, you're the surgeon who <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">dreads walking out the front door</span> each day for another <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">monotonous, soul-sucking day</span> of clinic. The constant feeling that you're <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">meant for more</span> while you feel like a <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">slave to your own body</span> eats away at your raw passion each minute. You're trying to <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">wear the mask of enthusiasm and authority</span>, but the <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">cracks are showing</span> to those you care about most.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 sm:mb-6">
            Your mind still <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">vigorously craves excellence</span>, but your body can't keep up with your standards and aspirations. And it shows. Your confidence dwindles as the days go by. Your dreams continue to <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">slip through your grasp</span>, hoping your colleagues won't notice the <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">internal dissonance</span>.

            The gap between <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">who you know you are</span> and <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">how you feel</span> is getting <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">impossible to ignore</span>.

          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 sm:mt-6">
            There's a silver-lining though. You're <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">inches away from flipping the script</span> and <span className="text-blue-600 font-bold">reclaiming control</span>...
